!  $ xmodmap -grammar
! xmodmap accepts the following input expressions:
!
!    pointer = default              reset pointer buttons to default
!    pointer = NUMBER ...           set pointer button codes
!    keycode NUMBER = [KEYSYM ...]  map keycode to given keysyms
!    keysym KEYSYM = [KEYSYM ...]   look up keysym and do a keycode operation
!    clear MODIFIER                 remove all keys for this modifier
!    add MODIFIER = KEYSYM ...      add the keysyms to the modifier
!    remove MODIFIER = KEYSYM ...   remove the keysyms from the modifier
!
! where NUMBER is a decimal, octal, or hex constant; KEYSYM is a valid
! Key Symbol name; and MODIFIER is one of the eight modifier names:  Shift,
! Lock, Control, Mod1, Mod2, Mod3, Mod4, or Mod5.  Lines beginning with
! an exclamation mark (!) are taken as comments.  Case is significant except
! for MODIFIER names.
!
! Keysyms on the left hand side of the = sign are looked up before any changes
! are made; keysyms on the right are looked up after all of those on the left
! have been resolved.  This makes it possible to swap modifier keys.
